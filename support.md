🛠 Frequently Asked Questions
1. My QR codes are saving, but I can’t find them.

All created and scanned QR codes appear under the Saved Codes screen.
Tap the clock-arrow icon on the top right of the Home screen.

2. How do I unlock GlowQR Pro?

Go to:
Settings → GlowQR Pro
—or tap any Pro theme or Pro feature and follow the upgrade prompt.

Pro unlocks:

No ads

No watermark

All Pro themes

High-resolution exports

Future premium features

This is a one-time purchase (no subscription).

3. I purchased Pro but the app didn’t unlock.

Try:

Closing and reopening the app

Going to the Paywall screen → tap Restore Purchases

If you still have issues, email me with:

Your Apple ID region (Canada, US, etc.)

The device you’re using

4. The QR scanner isn’t detecting anything.

Check:

Camera permissions are granted

Lighting is adequate

The code isn’t blurry or too small

If the issue continues, send a screenshot or description.

5. My camera isn’t working in the scanner.

Open Settings → Privacy → Camera and make sure GlowQR has permission.

6. Ads are not showing on my device.

If you unlocked GlowQR Pro previously (even in TestFlight), ads are disabled.
You can verify in the Paywall screen — it will show Pro as active.
